REST API developed project usuing .NET and C#. The API is designed using repository and dependency injection
design patterns in order to let the API be migrated with ease to other databases if required without affecting
its funtionality nor demand extensive modifications as this decouples the API funtionality from the database
operations.

It includes CRUD operations, authorizathion, authentication, and azure deployment.
A simple .NET web application to interact with the REST API which is not the main purpose of the current project.
